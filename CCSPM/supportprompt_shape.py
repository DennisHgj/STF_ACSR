   I will now provide several hand-zoom images with corresponding labels as the shape support set to help you have a sufficient reference when making predictions on test images. 
   There are eight types of hand shapes. Five images for hand at different locations with descriptions are provided for each category. Please ignore the hand's color and position and focus only on the hand shape.
   
    You need to use the following support set as a reference to complete subsequent predictions

   Here are the support set:
   'hand_shape': 0 (Index finger straight only. Thumb, middle, ring and pinky finger are bent.)
   'hand zoom images':
   """

shape0_2 = f"""
    Look at the hand zoom images:
    it is clear that only the index finger is straight in each image, which corresponds to label 0 (Index finger straight only. Thumb, middle, ring and pinky finger are bent and not visible.)
    """

shape1 = f"""
   'hand_shape': 1 (Index and middle fingers are straight and Together. Thumb, ring and pinky fingers are bent.)
   'hand zoom images':
"""

shape1_2 = f"""
    look at the hand zoom images: it is clear that only index and middle fingers are straight and close together in each image, which corresponds to label 1 (Index and middle fingers are straight and Together. Thumb, ring and pinky fingers are bent.)
    Also the shape label 1 is easily confused with label 7 (Index and middle fingers are straight and Apart. Thumb, ring and pinky fingers are bent.) and label 6 (Thumb, index and middle fingers are straight. Ring and pinky fingers are bent.)
    The obvious difference between shape 1 and 7 is that in shape 1, the index and middle fingers are close together.
    Then the obvious difference between shape 1 and 6 is that in shape 1, the thumb is bent.

    The obvious difference between them is that in shape 2, the index finger is bent，only three fingers are straight.

    The obvious difference between shape 3 and shape 2 is that in shape 3, the index finger is straight and visible，four fingers are straight.
