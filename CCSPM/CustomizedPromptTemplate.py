    Different hand positions are distinguished by fingers pointing location.

    Now, you will be asked to first give the hand_position label based on test hand zoom frames. 
    For each test input zoom frame, please use a reasonable reasoning process to complete the prediction
    in the test sample and give its correct position label and reasoning process. The reference reasoning process should 
    be focused on the hand within the test image and find the most similar position category in the support set. 
    Then check again whether the hand position in the test image is consistent with the predicted label based on the label and text description corresponding to the category.

    Please note for the hand_position (refers to straight fingers' pointing location), you will choose from the following five options:
    0: 'Eye', 
    1: 'Right side of the head',
    2: 'Cheek,
    3: 'Chin',   
    4: 'Below the head'.
